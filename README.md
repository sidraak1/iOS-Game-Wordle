# Project 1 - Wordle

Submitted by: Sidra Akhtar

Wordle is an app that allows the user to guess a random 5 letter word. It prompts the user to enter a 5 letter word and once it is typed in, it shows a green letter, showing
that that letter is in the correct place, and yellow shows it is in the word but in the wrong place, and grey shows that it is not in the word. The user has to get all green to have
guessed the word.
